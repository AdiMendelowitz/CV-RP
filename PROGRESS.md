## Emergency Actions

**If significantly behind schedule:**

1. **Identify bottlenecks:**
   - What's taking too long?
   - What's blocking progress?

2. **Prioritize ruthlessly:**
   - Keep: Core implementations, GitHub portfolio
   - Reduce: Blog post length, paper reading depth
   - Skip: Optional experiments, perfect documentation

3. **Ask for help:**
   - Stack Overflow for code issues
   - ML community for concepts
   - Peers for motivation

4. **Adjust timeline:**
   - It's okay to take 14-16 weeks instead of 12
   - Progress > Speed
